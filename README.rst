POI Guardians
####################

This program is to help playing the game *Command and Conquer: Tiberium
Alliances*. It will help you keep track of Points of Interest (POIs) and
player's bases so that you can direct movements to make sure the POIs
are adequately guarded.

Key features:

* Importing the POI list from CnC and outputting a CSV file

* Importing a list of bases per player and outputting a CSV file with one line per base

Key features planned:

* Assigning bases to POIs

    * Only 1 base per POI

    * No RP farms as guards

    * Only 1 base used from a player

    * Nearest base assigned

* Identifying POIs that are distant from the rest
